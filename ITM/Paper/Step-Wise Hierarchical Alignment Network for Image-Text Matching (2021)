Step-Wise Hierarchical Alignment Network for Image-Text Matching (2021)
Zhong Ji, Kexin Chen, Haoran Wang

Abstract 
Prior : Rely on single-step reasoning to discover the visual-semantic interactions 
--> lacks the ability of exploiting the multi-level information to locate the hierarchical fine-grained relevance

This work : Propose a ster-wise hierarchical alignment network (SHAN) which decomposes image-text matching into multi-step cross-modal reasoning process.
Firstly, Achieve local-to-local alignment at fragment level, following by performing global-to-local and global-to-global alignment at context level sequentially.
==> more complementary and sufficient semantic clues to understand the hierarchical correlations between image and text.



*Terminology
1. retrievel
2. cross- attention
