- Abstract
Propose Consensus-aware Visual Semantic Embedding (CVSE) model

Prior work : Tends to rely on only the image-text instance pair to learn their representations
--> Can exploit their matching relationships and making the corresponding alignments. & No consideration of common sense.
So, CVSE : to incorporate the consensus information, namely the commonsense knowledge shared between both modalities.

1. the consensus information is exploited by computing the statistical co-occurrence correlations between the semantic concepts from the image captioning corpus and deploying the constructed concept correlation graph to yield the consensus-aware concept(CAC) representations.
2. CVSE learns the associations and alignments between image and text based on the exploited consensus as well as the instance-levvel representations for both modalities.

*Terminology
1. R-CNN -> Fast R-CNN -> Faster R-CNN
2. VQA(visual qiestion answering), visual grounding, visual captioning, scene graph generation


Introduction
Figure 1 (a) : Use Deep NN to extract the global representations of both images and texts, based on which their similarities are measured.
Figure 1 (b) : performs the fragment-level matching and aggregates their similarities to measure their relevance.
--> yielding satisfactory bidirectional image-text retrieval results ==> can only rely on employing the image-text instance pair to perform cross-modal retrieval, which we name as instance-level alignment in this paper.
e.g., "A man on a surfboard riding on a ocean wave" with semantically-related image --> "surfboard", "wave" have high probability in both image and text. (co-occurance)
This paper will consider these factors just like as human being.
