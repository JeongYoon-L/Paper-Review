Deep Correlation for Matching Images and Text (2015) - Fei Yan

Propose an alternative end-to-end learning sccheme based on the deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA)

Extension of [1]
[1] : Evaluates DCCA on meduim-sized problems with low feature dimensionalities, allowing training in a full batch mode using the L-BFGS method.
Problem 1. 
So, this dimensionalities are 2 times higher magnitude of [1], which can better represent the data. But, limits the training to small batches and imposes overfitting problems.
Problem 2. 
The hiigher dimensionalities make the singular value decomposition (SVD) required by DCCA much more computationally intensive.
==> Propose the details of a GPU implementation with CULA libgraries.

**Terminology
1. Canonical Correlation -- 정준상관분석
: Correlation between two canonical or latent types of variables.
Can find a relationship between many dependent and independent variables.
