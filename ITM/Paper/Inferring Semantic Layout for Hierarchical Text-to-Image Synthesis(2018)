Inferring Semantic Layout for Hierarchical Text-to-Image Synthesis(2018)

Instead of learning a direct mapping from text to image, they propose an alternative approach that constructs semantic layout as an intermediate representation between text and image.
Semantic layout : a structure of scene based on object instances and provides fine-grained information of scene, such as the number of objets, object category, location, size, shape, etc. 

1. The layout generator
constructs a semantic label map from a text description

2. The image generator 
converts the estimated layout to an image using the text. 


- subtasks
1. Estimate the bounding box layout of an image using the box generator.
2. Refine the shape of each object inside the box by the shape generator.

Generating semantic layout 장점 
1. semantic layout provides instance wise annotations on generated images, which can be directly exploited for automated scene parsing and object retrieval.
2. it offers an interactive interface for controling image generation proess; users can modify the semantic layout to generate a desired image by removing/adding objects, changing size and location of objects, etc.
